## Summary

Here are trelliscope displays displaying the results of a study on unsupervised semantic segmentation 
algorithms. The "dimension reduction" and "blur" displays include studies of the 
effects of dimension reduction and blurring on segmentation algorithms, using a subset
of 10 images. The "full" display includes all segmented images on the entire dataset of 30 
images.
