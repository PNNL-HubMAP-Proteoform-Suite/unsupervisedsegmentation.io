## Summary

Here are trelliscope displays for two studies conducted within our unsupervised
semantic segmentation project. The first, blur, studied the effect of blurring
images on algorithmic performance using the subset. Those results informed whether
blurring was applied to the second study, "full", where segmentation methods were
applied to all images.
